# Introduction

The Sugarscape model is a well-established tool for exploring the dynamics of resource distribution, movement, and inequality in agent-based systems. However, the model overlooks the psychological and social factors that influence individual decision-making. In real-world settings, individuals do not simply act based on environmental cues. Instead, they often make decisions based on their perceptions of others. This leads to the central research question of this project: How do different agent behaviors, specifically competitive versus cooperative strategies, impact the distribution of resources and inequality within an agent-based environment?

I hypothesize that agents who engage in competitive social comparison (striving to accumulate more resources than their peers) will lead to a higher degree of inequality and faster resource depletion. This behavior will result in a higher Gini coefficient and decreased survival rates, as agents compete for limited resources. On the other hand, agents who engage in cooperative social comparison (moderating their resource consumption when they are ahead) will contribute to more equitable and sustainable outcomes, though they may sacrifice individual efficiency for group stability.

To introduce psychological realism into the Sugarscape model, I draw on Festinger's (1954) Social Comparison Theory, which posits that individuals determine their own social and personal worth based on how they stack up against others. According to this theory, people tend to evaluate themselves by comparing themselves to others in various domains, including material wealth or status. In the context of this model, agents adjust their behavior depending on their sugar stores relative to their neighbors. If an agent perceives itself as having more sugar than its neighbors, it will moderate its sugar consumption to maintain fairness and avoid over-accumulation. If it has less sugar, the agent will prioritize high-sugar areas more aggressively to catch up.

This modification significantly alters the original interpretation of Sugarscape agents. In the baseline model, agents were treated as individualistic, self-interested consumers simply trying to maximize their own sugar reserves. By incorporating social comparison, agents become more akin to individuals embedded in a social system where their actions are not solely dictated by survival instincts but also by their relative standing in the social hierarchy. This shift introduces a psychological layer, making the agents more realistic as they are influenced by social dynamics, such as status-seeking or altruism.

# Implementation Details

To implement social comparison, I modified the agent’s decision-making process for movement and resource acquisition in the sugarscape code. Agents are randomly assigned one of two behaviors: competitive or cooperative. Competitive agents act in the traditional sugarscape manner, prioritizing high-sugar cells when their sugar stores are lower than average. Cooperative agents, however, modify their resource consumption depending on their sugar reserves in comparison to their neighbors. If their sugar stores exceed the average sugar levels of nearby agents, they lower their preference for high-sugar cells, giving other agents a chance to collect resources.

This modification involves calculating the average sugar levels of an agent’s adjacent neighbors. Based on this comparison, agents adjust their movement towards cells, weighing not only environmental factors but also their relative standing. ​​Technically, this behavior is implemented by calculating the average sugar level of an agent’s adjacent neighbors and dynamically adjusting movement decisions based on both environmental conditions and the agent’s relative standing. These behavioral adjustments are updated every tick of the simulation. By including this new decision-making behavior, the sugarscape model reflects a more nuanced social interaction between agents.

# Observations and Speculative Results

In the simulation with both competitive and cooperative agents, the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, shows a decrease and eventual stabilization over time. This is primarily driven by the cooperative agents' tendency to moderate their sugar consumption when they have more than their neighbors. By avoiding excessive accumulation, they help reduce extreme disparities in resource distribution, leading to a more balanced sugar distribution overall. However, despite the reduction in inequality, agents continue to cluster around high-sugar areas.

The competitive agents, in particular, drive the clustering in these resource-rich zones. As they prioritize high-sugar cells when their sugar stores are lower than the average of their neighbors, they aggressively seek out these areas, exacerbating the concentration of agents in resource hotspots. Even cooperative agents, while more cautious in their sugar consumption, still gravitate towards high-sugar areas to ensure survival. Interestingly, over time, the population of cooperative agents declines more than that of competitive agents, likely due to their moderated resource consumption making them more vulnerable to depletion. Despite their smaller numbers, cooperative agents continue to cluster, suggesting that the drive to survive near abundant resources is strong enough to override individual behavioral differences.

In contrast, if only competitive agents are present, inequality quickly increases. High-performing agents monopolize rich sugar areas, while weaker agents struggle to survive, leading to a higher Gini coefficient. This contrast underscores the complexity of social comparison: while cooperation can mitigate inequality by moderating sugar consumption, it does not eliminate the competitive dynamics that drive clustering in high-resource regions. Even cooperative agents, despite their efforts to balance resource accumulation, still tend to cluster around these resource-rich zones, reflecting the inherent competition for survival within limited environments.
